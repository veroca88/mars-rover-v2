# Basic Information
Our Mars Rover is kind of dumb. By that, we mean it can’t move and turn at the same time. This means that if the rover wants to move to the left, it’s first move must be a turn. Its next move will then be a step forward.

We will discuss this concept in more detail as we progress through the exercise.

In addition, our rover is on a test mission. NASA has placed the rover on a 10x10 grid to make sure all is well before we ship it off to mars.

At a high level, what we will do in the exercise is the following:

Create a function to turn the rover.
Create a function to move the rover forwards or backwards based on its direction.
Create a function to receive a list of commands and move based off of those commands.
